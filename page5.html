      Step inside a parallel universe where dance unites all souls regardless of age, persuasion or background: <i>DROP</i> is a dance music movement taking Europe by storm.
    
      Inspired by the iconic parties of 80s Chicago and New York, such as <i>The Loft, Paradise Garage</i> and<i> the Warehouse,</i> DROP champions an environment open to all regardless of faith, race, class, gender or sexual orientation.
    
      Renowned for our uplifting atmosphere, we believe the key to creating unforgettable dance floor experiences is a sense of community, freedom and respect amongst partygoers.
    
      We bring together world-class DJs, local rising stars, high-energy dance performers and drag queens to create a unique party experience. Expect to hear soulful house, glittering disco, and timeless dance floor anthems, with artists such as <i>Folamour, Dave Lee, Dan Shake, Demuja, Crazy P, Cinthie, Bellaire, Black Loops, Ash Lauryn, COEO</i> and <i>Cody Currie</i> at the helm.
    
      Our philosophy is simple: <b>‘Music is made for dancing, and everybody is equal on the dancefloor’.</b> Surrender yourself to the rhythm. Let that bass penetrate. Join us in championing freedom of expression and celebrating diversity.
