      Music has a unique ability to evoke deep emotions, often in ways that are hard to explain. It can bring us to tears, make our hearts race, or create an unspoken bond between us and those around us. But why does music have such a profound impact on our emotions?

      On the surface, music may seem like a purely abstract art form — just organised sound waves, seemingly unrelated to our daily survival. And yet, it has the power to stir some of our most intense feelings. This paradox raises an intriguing question: How does something so intangible provoke reactions that are deeply rooted in our biology?

      The answer lies in understanding how sounds carry meaning. For our ancestors, survival depended on their ability to detect, interpret, and respond to sound patterns. Recognising the growl of a predator, the rhythm of approaching footsteps, or the comforting tones of a caregiver’s voice were matters of life and death. Over generations, our brains evolved to process sounds emotionally, providing the foundation for our modern reactions to music.

    The Universal Appeal of Music<br>
      From ancient rituals to today’s global streaming platforms, music has been a constant thread throughout human culture. Regardless of where we are, music manifests in countless forms — be it rhythmic drumming in African communities, classical symphonies in Europe, or pop hits that cross the globe. Music bridges cultures and connects us to our shared humanity.

      So, why is music such a universal phenomenon? The answer is embedded in our evolutionary past. Before language, humans used sound as a primary form of communication. Babies, for example, recognise the emotional tone of a song long before they understand the words, suggesting that our connection to music is innate rather than learned¹.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      Looking back at early humans, sound played a crucial role in survival. Recognising environmental patterns — like the rustling of leaves, the rhythm of rain, or the comfort of a caregiver’s voice — was essential for safety². Over time, our brains became wired to detect and respond emotionally to these cues. Music, with its organised patterns and emotional resonance, taps into these ancient responses.

      Beyond survival, music has always served as a social glue. From tribal dances to national anthems, music has united people, helping them express shared emotions and build collective identities³. Even in today’s world, music fosters connection. At concerts or festivals, the collective experience of singing along to a song creates a powerful sense of belonging.

      Although the functions of music have evolved, its essence remains the same. Where it once helped coordinate movement, celebrate rituals, and strengthen bonds, it now facilitates self-expression, storytelling, and emotional release. The beauty of music lies in its ability to communicate emotion without the need for understanding the lyrics. Regardless of language, the melodies and rhythms speak to something deep within us, connecting us all. Whether in moments of joy, sorrow, or introspection, music remains the soundtrack to our lives.

    Understanding Music and Emotion: The BRECVEMA Model<br>
      Music has an extraordinary power to evoke emotion, and one of the most comprehensive frameworks to explain how this happens is the BRECVEMA model. Developed by researcher Patrik Juslin, it identifies seven key psychological processes that shape our emotional response to music⁵. By understanding these processes, we gain insight into why music has such a profound impact on us.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Brainstem Reflex: The Startle Response<br>
      The most basic emotional response to music — or any sound — is the brainstem reflex, a survival-driven reaction triggered by sudden, unexpected changes in sound. Imagine walking through a quiet forest, and a branch snaps nearby. Instantly, your heart races, your body tenses, and you’re on high alert. This is the brainstem reflex in action.

      In music, this reflex is often sparked by loud, sudden noises, like a cymbal crash in an orchestra or a sharp sound effect in a film. Think of the suspense in a horror movie where the music builds, then halts abruptly, making us hold our breath in anticipation. When the scare comes — whether it’s a sudden scream or a loud crash — it hits harder because of the heightened alertness caused by the brainstem reflex.

      This reflex isn’t limited to fear; it also plays a role in excitement. For instance, when a beat drops in dance music, the sudden shift in sound leads to an emotional rush, a thrilling release of tension. These natural, instinctual reactions are woven into our experience of music.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Rhythmic Entrainment: Moving to the Beat<br>
      Rhythmic entrainment refers to our tendency to align our bodies with the rhythm of the music we’re hearing. Have you ever found yourself tapping your foot, nodding your head, or even dancing to a catchy beat? That’s rhythmic entrainment at play. Our brains are naturally attuned to pick up the beat, and our bodies instinctively follow.

      This can be especially powerful during exercise. When you’re running to a playlist with a rhythm that matches your pace, the beat helps you maintain a steady tempo without consciously thinking about it. The rhythm guides your movements, making it easier to keep going.

      But rhythmic entrainment doesn’t only work with fast beats. Slower tempos, like the calming rhythms of meditation music, can also influence your body. These tracks can lower your heart rate and guide your body into a state of relaxation, showing how deeply music can connect with our physical and mental state, regardless of the tempo.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Evaluative Conditioning: Music’s Emotional Associations<br>
      Evaluative conditioning explains how music not only amplifies our current emotions but also carries deep emotional connections based on past experiences. Music becomes tied to memories, almost like an emotional bookmark. For example, a song from a memorable road trip with friends can instantly take you back to that carefree time, or a tune from your teenage years can bring back a flood of nostalgia.

      Christmas music is another example. Even in the middle of summer, hearing familiar festive tunes brings an immediate sense of warmth, joy, and the spirit of togetherness. These songs are so deeply linked to the holiday season that they can evoke specific feelings, no matter when or where you hear them.

      Music can also carry negative emotional associations. Think of the eerie, suspenseful music in horror films — the infamous Jaws theme or the screeching violins in Psycho. Over time, these soundtracks have become synonymous with danger, and hearing them instantly evokes feelings of dread.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Contagion: Music as Emotional Transmission<br>
      Ever heard a sad song and found yourself tearing up, even though you weren’t feeling down? That’s emotional contagion. When we hear music expressing a particular emotion, our brains instinctively mirror it, making us feel that emotion ourselves.

      What’s intriguing is how emotional contagion can shift our existing emotions. For example, you might enter a room feeling stressed, but when an upbeat song plays, your mood can suddenly change. Music has the power to evoke emotions we weren’t already feeling, and this is what makes it so influential. This phenomenon also explains how music brings people together. When a song expresses a shared emotion — be it happiness, sadness, or love — it creates a sense of connection. Music becomes a universal language, capable of uniting people through shared emotional experiences.

    Visual Imagery: Music That Paints Pictures<br>
      Music doesn’t just affect us emotionally — it can also engage our imagination. Ever listen to a piece of music and find yourself picturing scenes or stories in your mind? That’s visual imagery in action. Music can evoke mental images so vivid that it feels as though you’re watching a movie in your mind.

      Take the Harry Potter theme, for example. The iconic notes immediately transport you to the magical world of Hogwarts, filled with broomsticks and enchanted creatures. Similarly, Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons evokes vivid images of changing seasons, from the blossoming of spring to the stillness of winter.

      This ability to ignite creativity and imagination is one of music’s most powerful qualities. It doesn’t just engage our senses; it invites us to see the world in new and imaginative ways.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Episodic Memory: Music as a Time Capsule<br>
      Music can act as a time capsule, instantly transporting us to a specific moment, place, or emotion. When we hear a familiar song, it’s more than just a melody — it’s a key that unlocks memories we may have forgotten.

      Think of the song that reminds you of a special summer holiday, or one that takes you back to a time spent with a close friend. These songs become so intertwined with our personal history that they take on greater significance. They remind us of who we were, where we’ve been, and the experiences that shaped us. Whether it’s a song from a first date, a holiday, or a childhood memory, music has an extraordinary ability to connect us to our past, making it an emotional anchor that keeps our memories alive.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      Research into the reminiscence bump — the period between the ages of 10 and 30 when we form the most emotionally charged memories — shows that music from this time is particularly potent in evoking vivid recollections. This is why throwback playlists hold such emotional weight, taking us back to the milestones and experiences that shaped who we are. Music becomes a bridge to our past, helping us relive those moments with remarkable clarity.

      In essence, music is more than just sound — it becomes part of our identity, helping us feel more connected to the people we were and the experiences that have shaped us into who we are today. It is, without a doubt, one of the most personal and emotionally rich ways we experience music, offering us a sense of continuity and meaning throughout our lives.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Musical Expectancy: Predicting and Reacting to Sound<br>
      Our brains are constantly anticipating where a piece of music will take us, shaping how we experience it emotionally. When music aligns with our expectations, it can feel satisfying and comforting. However, when it defies our expectations — through an unexpected chord change or a shift in tempo — it generates excitement and surprise.

      This balance between anticipation and surprise is what keeps music engaging. DJs, for instance, excel at building tension, teasing the crowd with an impending drop. Classical composers like Beethoven and Mozart were masters of withholding resolution, creating suspense that made the payoff all the more rewarding.

      This interplay of predictability and novelty is what keeps us hooked on music, keeping the experience dynamic and emotionally rich. Music that strikes the right balance — where we feel the tension between knowing what’s coming and experiencing the joy of being surprised — tends to resonate most deeply with us. Take Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, for instance. The song is full of unexpected twists and turns. Just when you think you’ve figured it out, it shifts genres, changes tempo, or changes mood entirely. It’s a prime example of defying expectations, and this is part of what makes it so beloved.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    Aesthetic Judgement: Deciding What Sounds Good<br>
      Finally, aesthetic judgment relates to the ability to appreciate music not just for its emotional impact but also for its inherent beauty and artistry. Recognising the technical qualities of a piece — such as harmony, melody, and rhythm — allows us to appreciate music as a form of art, regardless of its emotional resonance.

      Take The Blue Danube by Strauss. While it might not stir intense emotions in everyone, its elegance and technical brilliance are undeniable. The seamless transitions, and the interaction between strings and woodwinds — these elements contribute to its timeless appeal.

      The ability to appreciate music on an aesthetic level allows us to connect with pieces of art that might not directly reflect our personal experiences or emotions. This is why we can listen to a symphony or a complex jazz composition and admire its craftsmanship, even if it doesn’t evoke a deep emotional connection in that particular moment. Sometimes, music is simply beautiful because of how it is made — and that is more than enough.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    The takeaways
    <br>
      Music’s ability to evoke emotions, spark memories, and connect us to our deeper selves is nothing short of magical. From the instinctive brainstem reflex to the emotional weight of evaluative conditioning, music influences us on a primal level. It moves us, shakes us, and helps us remember moments we might otherwise forget. Next time you listen to a song, pay attention to how it makes you feel — it’s not just music; it’s a deep connection to your body, mind, and memories.
