          One thing that I have taken note of in today's current social media landscape is how a lot of Gen Z is starting to promote their rejection of digital overload they experience daily. I find it interesting because Gen Z is considered to be the generation that grew up with the internet and it being heavily prevalent in every aspect of their lives. I feel as though after covid, the social distancing, and the lockdowns, the majority of Gen Z is tired of the instant gratification and the lack of in person interaction and connection they have experienced from being consumed by social media and other aspects of the internet. You may disagree with me, which is okay, but a lot of the people I have talked to have told me ways in which they are trying to limit their screen time in order to be more present and positively productive in their lives. A few of those have also been trends I saw from influencers boasting how they limit their screen time being through; digital cameras rather than the camera app, walkmans or record players instead of Spotify or Apple Music, physical books rather than e-readers, finding new outlets to take up time rather than doom scrolling.

          I have taken the initiative to limit my screen time as well simply because I have found that I use social media as an easy outlet for when I am bored, and it has no real positive effect on my life besides offering me recipes for dinner! Instead of listening to Spotify all of the time I have started downloading my music onto my <i>Sony Walkman</i>, which has been an amazing experience and change in my life as I no longer have to suffer from constant ads. Music is my break from the constant noise I hear all day and it gives me a sense of relief as I can just fade into the beat and get work done, relax, or dance. Apps like <i>Spotify</i> and <i>Apple Music</i> are great because they offer millions of songs, hundreds of genres at a simple and quick tap of your fingers, but if you don't want to suffer from ads, you’re stuck paying a monthly fee to experience being ad free.

          I have also reconnected with paper and pen, rather than taking notes on my iPad. I have been utilizing my iPad as my notebook for every class using apps such as <i>Notability</i> since my junior year of highschool. Now while this has saved money on purchasing the notebooks, paper, and writing supplies for each class every year/semester, it has also had some noteworthy drawbacks. One of them being the hardship it has put onto my hands. What has drawn me back into paper and pen is the fact that it is easy to measure how much pressure is being put onto the page compared to when writing on the iPad. I have even gone as far as trying a paperlike screen protector and changing the tips of my stylus, but it has had little effect on my hands and the writing callus I have on my fingers have actually worsened. The second being that it has also provided me with less distractions. In class, writing on the iPad, taking notes – then <b>BOOM</b>!! A notification pops up, distracting me from what I was writing down that the professor said was going to be on the test next week. Not only has my attention span not been bothered by notifications constantly popping up, but my hands have been in much less pain than usual and I'm starting to think that maybe early onset arthritis has been evaded!!

          The last thing that has helped with lessening my doom scrolling has actually been trying new things either one off experiences or trying to find a new hobby. I am a qualified jack-of-all-hobbies! I try my best to implement new hobbies or activities that better my physical and mental health that are not related to using any screen whatsoever; whether it is crocheting, drawing, painting, running, hiking, photography, building, etc. I have probably tried it…and possibly moved on a little too quickly! The fact that I struggle sticking to a hobby that I genuinely enjoy can also be seen as the struggle most people are having when trying to limit their screen time because these types of hobbies don’t really offer instant gratification, rather slow gratification that comes with time and consistency.

          Now I challenge others to implement ways in which they can also limit their screen time and over all doom scrolling. The reason why I call this article Universal Nostalgia is to reference back to before our generation started using the internet and social media as ways of passing time. If you want to get into photography, go get a film camera, if you want to play video games, try finding an active activity that gets you up and going. Really try reflecting back on the things that gave you joy and entertainment growing up and also the things that you might not realize that bring you happiness now. It can be a hard adjustment considering how long social media has been an outlet for passing time in today's world, but I can promise you that a little exploration will help improve your physical, emotional, and mental state, and who knows – you might even meet new friends along your journey!
