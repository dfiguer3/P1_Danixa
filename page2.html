      I watched a video today about the philosophy behind the original writing of Frankenstein and it was really well put together. The explanations, I mean, the video itself was just illustrations and the video author speaking in the background with subtitles. And admittedly the first 35 minutes had the most new information, there was a bit of repetition in the last 25ish minutes. But not everything was entirely repetitive after that point. I really identified with a lot of the points made, but I'm not sure if I came out of it feeling more seen or more hopeless. Maybe both. It felt very bittersweet.
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      It starts by explaining the different variations of the story, and how as time goes on and new adaptations are created, the original idea behind it is lost. Newer versions continue to make Frankenstein's monster more horrific and more stupid and more violent, because there is a solution to that - to get rid of the monster - and having an immediate solution makes the comfortable in society feel safe. In contrast, the original Frankenstein's monster was an intelligent and empathetic being. Still, he was too large and his face was lopsided and his was skin not quite right, so everyone ran from him with fear or beat him with hostility. He was curious when he first woke, but the curiosity shifts throughout the story to longing, then to helplessness, and finally to apathy and acceptance. It didn't matter how hard he tried to contribute, how kind he was to others, how many lives he helped or tried to save; he was always seen as a monster because he was fundamentally different from everyone else. At the begining, He believed that all he had to do was to be kind and to keep trying to prove his worth and that eventually his virtues would allow him to be accepted into society, but it didn't. He eventually accepts that society will not change its view of him because of fundamental differences that he cannot change about himself. He stops trying to conform, which leads to the end of his own life.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      The original story is an example of an extreme that can be seen in our own world among the mentally and chronically ill especially, but also within marginalized minority communities. The story doesn't offer a solution or give some sort of redemption, it simply asks us if this is the type of society that we are willing to live in. If we are okay with minimizing and categorizing people based on traits they cannot change, and if we are okay with out-casting minorities who don't fit into those pre-existing groups. Throughout history the answer seems to change between yes and no.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      There is an added element to the story; when Frankenstein's monster realizes he cannot change how others see him, he tracks down his maker and forces him to make another like himself with the idea that he could have someone who loves and understands him, because they would be hated together. Frankenstein agrees to this request, because though he is terrified, he also sees that he has created this monster's suffering. Before he is completed with this second being, He has a change of heart. Frankenstein wonders if creating another would only cause more suffering. And thus he decides to rip the body apart. The monster, who was watching from the window. Comes into the house and tells Frankenstein that he will see him on his wedding day. When the time arrives. The monster kills Frankenstein's wife and leaves him just as alone as the monster was designed to be. Frankenstein then, in despair for his wife's lost life, dedicates the rest of his own life to chasing the monster.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      The monster leaves behind clues, because for the first time in his life he is desired, and he can't seem to care that it is in a horrible way. When Frankenstein dies of old age, the monster is heartbroken, because no matter how cruel their initial meeting, and no matter how horrible their meetings after where, the one who created him and the one who kept him company, in a sense, had now died.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      This is the part of the story that I didn't entirely identify with, or at least not directly. Though I guess at some levels, in alternative ways, I can to some extent: I hate that the people who have hurt me and led me/forced me to engage in harmful behaviors were able to get away with it. I wish they knew how I felt and how it has effected me - but I don't wish for it to happen to them. Not exactly. I just wish they would gain the empathy to understand. With my chronic illnesses, I think it is cruel of the nature to have allowed me to suffer with them, and to make things feel worse and worse no matter how hard I try. I think it is cruel that there will always be people who think I am not trying, or that if I am, then clearly not hard enough, and that's why things don't feel as though they are getting better. I wish those people understood how I felt day to day, so I could ask them: if they they existed with the level of pain and exhaustion that I am in, do they really think they'd be able to do any better? Still, I don't want them to experience what I have and what I am; I just want them to understand.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      I know that it is a lack of understanding that creates their sort of thinking. I know that it isn't my fault that this has all happened to me. I think that puts me in the final phase of the monster's story, where he recognizes that though he is "flawed" by society's standards, but also that he is not at fault for that. Rather, the blame falls onto the institutions and beliefs systems which had put those standards into place. Then again, maybe I'm not quite to the end of the story yet, because even though I know it likely won't get me anywhere and I know it'll likely only cause me more suffering, I want to find a way to exist in the version of the world where I live with less pain and there is more love and more kindness. Even if deep down, I don't believe that it's truly possible, at least not In my lifetime. So yes It doesn't make me feel less hopeless, but It does make me feel seen.
</div>
  <br>
<div>
      (B: We do wish to be understood, but it is very hard to achieve as we are all different with our own experiences.)
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      I think that's where a new form of empathy comes in. Not pity or baby-ing, but the understanding that our experiences are all different. What we can expect of ourselves cannot always be expected of others. In most cases, it cannot. Frankenstein's monster would likely have never gone down the path he did if people didn't undermine his efforts or react based only on his physical form, but instead, acknowledged the work that he was putting forward and treated him with kindness. We can accommodate and help and be kind to disabled, to mentally unwell, and to marginalized people without demeaning them at the same time. The issue is that so many people see someone who lives, or behaves, or looks differently from themselves or the average person, and are immediately ready to cast them aside or treat them as lesser because they aren't meeting up to the standards they place on themselves (as the onlooker).

      Side tangent:
      It's also not just enough to say that a group of people is equal. Steps and actions have to take place to allow that equality. I heard an analogy that explains my thought well. I'll try and see if I can find where it came from, but this is the general idea: A business owner hates people in wheelchairs. When constructing his business building, he includes no ramps, only stairs, and even puts a sign in the door saying "no people with wheelchairs." When that business owner sells the building, the new owner takes down the sign, because he doesn't hate people in wheelchairs and wants them to feel welcome on his property. Despite the fact that the sign is no longer there, and despite the fact that people in wheelchairs are technically allowed, the only entrances to the building are surrounded by stairs. Without adequate help, wheelchair users still cannot get into the building. You could say that technically, wheelchair users and non-users are equal, but they will not be truly equal until there is a ramp option for the wheelchair users so that they have access to the building. Implementing the ramp would be a lot more inconvenient for the building owner than taking the sign down was, but it would be the right thing to do, morally, and is a necessary step in allowing wheelchair users to gain the same access as other non-users. The lender himself and the surrounding able-bodied community have to be the ones to do it, because the wheelchair users do not have the ability to do so.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      To tie this back in, I feel like a lot of society feels inconvenienced by the idea of changing their preconceived notions about specific groups. Keeping things the same feels easier and more comfortable, and change requires effort. To pity or baby individuals who are impacted negatively by the system is sort of like taking down the sign but doing nothing further. They may mean well, but they are still not doing anything to fix the actual damage caused by the initial problem.
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      In all honesty, I guess I don't exactly know what a perfect outcome would look like; not entirely. I mean, universal healthcare, mental health services to those who need it, education of mental health in schools, empathy exercises for people of all ages? Those would all be great. Maybe putting our phones down more often and having face to face connection with all types of people from all types of backgrounds to help us build that connection and empathy. Maybe finding a way to unearth our own judgement and to allow ourselves to ponder different ideas and perspectives, to communicate our thoughts and ideas clearly and without innuendo or "hinting" which often leads to miscommunication, especially among individuals with ASD, ADHD, OCD, etc. Maybe on an enviorment level, dimmer lighting, not too dim but not blinding, to help with those who become overstimulated easily. Maybe we stop with fireworks, so that we are actually honoring veterans who may have PTSD and struggle with the loud crashing sounds. Maybe proper display of trigger warnings for certain media - but not censorship, because that in itself forces the suppression of healing and growth. Maybe communities supporting small businesses over large corporations, so that people who are unable to work on the traditional corporate timeline have the ability to sustain themselves (with the added bonus that we would stop relying on over-seas child and slave labor for our goods).
</div>
  <br>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      Obviously it wouldn't be possible for everything to be implemented in a day. And obviously there is more that would have to be done that I likely haven't even thought of yet. But It feels like it has to be possible, even if all of it requires a huge amount of empathy from everyone involved.
